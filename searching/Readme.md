## What is a Search Algorithm

In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values. Specific applications of search algorithms include:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- A*
- Database Index Lookup
- ...many more!

In a nutshell, this is simply an algorithm that looks through a dataset for a specific item and returns that item's location.

## Linear Search

In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. The list must be ordered for this search method be be most viable, although, it may handle unordered data sets as well.

## Substring Search

This exercise builds on the knowledge obtained through the Linear Search Exercise.

## Binary Search

In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
