# Algorithms

This is an attempt to generate more content for junior developers or those attempting to learn object oriented programming. This is currently being developed by [@bahodge](https://www.github.com/bahodge) & [@nestorsalinas88](https://www.github.com/nestorsalinas88). We are taking inspiration from several sources but focusing them down to modern problems.
Languages

In an effort to appeal to the most amount of people, we are developing all of these problem sets in the following languages:

- JavaScript w/ es6 syntax
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Java
- (Python) if steven wants to.

## Algorithms

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.
Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
